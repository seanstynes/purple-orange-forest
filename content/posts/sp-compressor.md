#A great mini pedal Compressor capable for parallel compression

The SP Compressor is one of my favorite pedal compressors. It comes in a smaller mini pedal form factor, which saves precious room on your pedal board. Plus it has a great sound and allows you to blend the compressed signal with the dry uncompressed signal. That way you can dial in some groove and tone but ease it back a bit to keep dynamics and transients. 

The secret weapon of the SP Compressor is the internal controls and the fact that this pedal works as a great amp driver/boost pedal. The volume knob provides really great sounding gain that can help you get a tube amp to really break up without cranking the amps volume all the way up. Once you screw off the back panel of the SP compressor you'll see four dip switches. These let you control the attack and release times, a low pass filter, and a high pass filter. The high and low pass filters are very useful because they save you needing to add an EQ pedal to your board.
