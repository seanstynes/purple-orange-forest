#A cutting edge audio interface and vintage gear rack in-a-box

Universal audio consistently delivers high quality interfaces paired with an amazing library of analog emulating plugins. The Apollo interfaces come with built in DPS chips that enable you to take some of the processing load off of your computer. The interface will actually run UAD plugins in real time. This allows you to track with compression, delay, reverb...etc, which leads to more inspiration and better performances.

The price tag is hefty for this interface but the quality of the conversion, preamps, and drivers makes it all worth while. 

**Pros**
* High Quality D/A Converters
* Unison Preamp Technology
* Impedance Matching
* Access to Top Notch Plugins

**Cons**
* Price tag of the interface
* Price of buying UAD plugins once you become engrossed in their universe
* Lack of some physical controls
